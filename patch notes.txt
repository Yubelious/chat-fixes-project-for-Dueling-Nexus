CSS FIXES PROJECT
**Patch Notes**
v3 The project has long since been out of date. Applied fixes to the current website, as it now appears after its major overhaul. Much of the features remain the same, but some were deemed unnecesary. Most notibly, the card names in the search results no longer scroll, and instead, excessively long names overflow into the card image. Everything should just fit now.
